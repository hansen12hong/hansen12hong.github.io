excerpt: 'This paper investigates the economic impacts of the "Taobao Villages (TBVs)" program in China, a bottom-up pilot on rural e-commerce that is imitated na-tionwide under top-down directives. Contrary to previous findings that confirm the positive role of TBVs in promoting village economies, our nationwide analysis finds that the establishment of TBVs significantly reduces night light of townships. Suugestive evidence shows that the strategic behavior of local governments could be the potential channel.'

Policy experimentations are widely accepted instruments for promoting economic growth in many countries. However, the effects may be undermined if they're masked by top-down enforcement that ignores local conditions. Using satellite night light data, we investigate the economic impacts of the "Taobao Villages (TBVs)" program in China, a bottom-up pilot on rural e-commerce that is imitated nationwide under top-down directives. Exploiting the difference-in-differences approach, we show that the establishment of TBVs significantly reduces townships' night light and therefore local economic growth. We further reveal that the top-down directives in TBVs' establishment and the strategic behaviors of local officials motivated by political incentives are the potential driving forces.
