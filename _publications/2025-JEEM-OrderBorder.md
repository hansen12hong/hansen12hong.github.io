excerpt: "This paper presents new evidence on how multitasking local governments' strategic responses to top-down environmental regulations can induce pollution in border areas. Using the implementation of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan in China as a quasi-experiment, we exploit a difference-in-differences model and find that this policy induces the border effect of air pollution. We further reveal a salient window dressing behavior of local governments, which air pollution in border counties reduces significantly as the high-stakes inspection time neared, followed by a dramatic increase soon after the inspection. These results are driven by local government responses to incomprehensive air quality monitor stations installed in non-border counties, and local officials with strong promotion incentives, who exert strict regulations in non-border counties, and varied regulations in border counties over time to cater for multitasking of economic growth and air quality targets."

The effectiveness of housing purchase limits policieshas aroused heated debate, yet few discussed its impacton educational capitalization. We examine the hetero-geneous effect of housing purchase limits policy onthe price of elite school district houses (ESDH) andnon-elite school district houses. By exploiting second-hand houses data in Hefei China, we find that theprice of ESDH has increased greatly after the limita-tion, compared with non-elite school districts. Furtherwe discover that the ESDH have lower depreciationrisks, and their price is higher in neighborhoods withsmaller dwelling area. Our finding indicates that thelimits policy may have exacerbated the educationalcapitalization.
